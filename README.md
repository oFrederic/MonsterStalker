<h2>About</h2>

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.
This is a very simple API populate with 5 monsters for now

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

- Create a CRUD API service using Express/GraphQL, Relational database
- Write tests for your API
- Seed your database with interesting data
- Be able to document your API endpoints for other developers to use, aka a beautiful README
- Create a basic/simple frontend

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- CRUD
- Express
- Knez
- Postgres

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

- An Express server that:

  - has a create endpoint for adding to your database (POST)
  - has a read endpoint for reading from your database (GET)
  - has an update endpoint for editing to your database (PATCH/PUT)
  - has a delete endpoint for deleting from your database (DELETE)

- OR a GraphQL Server that:

  - serves up a basic HTML file that describes your API service
  - Has multiple types to query
  - Offers mutations to delete, add, or modify data

- A basic HTML file that gets served up. It should have the name of your API and link to your API's GitHub folder
- Migration files
- A script that will set up and seed a database
- API Documentation in the form of a README.md file https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme
- The top of your readme should say “This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis”
- A demo, but make sure to talk about what the API is about and the endpoints. Make sure your setup works!
- Publish your code to Github and make it public

<h2>How it works ?</h2>

- GET all monsters: /api/monster
- GET a single monster: /api/monster/{id}
- DELETE a single monster: /api/monster/{id}
- PATCH a single monster: /api/monster/{id}
- POST a single monster: /api/monster/{id}

<h2>Project status</h2>

Work in progress!!!
